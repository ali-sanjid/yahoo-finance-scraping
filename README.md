# yahoo-finance-scraping (python project)
just scraping stock data from yahoo finance website using requests

# about the project
This was one of my first webscraping projects. Yes, i did surf youtube to find a easy one and pretty much copy pasted during the time I was writing it. But after around six months, when I went back to this same code, everything makes sense now!!

# the Code:
*the function 'getData' collects basically collects the desired data using requests.
*paramaters has been set to be more flexible when choosing specific data
*the raw data was converted to a list and then to a dataframe to make it easier to analyze.
